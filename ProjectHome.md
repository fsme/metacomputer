What is a Metacomputer?

> The metacomputer is a collection of computers held together by state-of-the-art technology and "balanced" so that, to the individual user, it looks and acts like a single computer. The constituent parts of the resulting "metacomputer" could be housed locally, or distributed between buildings, even continents.

A Short History of the Metacomputer

> NCSA Director, Larry Smarr, coined the term "metacomputing" around 1987 to describe his concept of a connected, coherent computing environment. It wasn't very long before computational scientists began to demonstrate its potential to accelerate research in many fields of science and engineering.
